# Object_Detection_Tracking_Yolo_Kalman
This notebook demonstrates an advanced object tracking pipeline using YOLO for detection and a Kalman filterâ€“based tracker with ghost track prevention. It processes video input to detect and track objects, assigns unique IDs, filters out unreliable tracks, visualizes results, and saves both annotated video and CSV tracking data.
